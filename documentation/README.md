# Documentation For the Environmental Data Intelligence Toolkit

## Viewing Documentation Site

As this website cannot be hosted at the moment, to view the documentation a local web server is needed.

This can be done on NCI in the meantime, and port forwarded.

However, the development branch will only contain the neccessary files to build the docs, but not the docs.
Checkout `docs` to view the built docs

### NCI Commands

```bash
module load nodejs
npm install serve
npx serve site/
```

A similar set of commands can be used for a user installed nodejs environment.
