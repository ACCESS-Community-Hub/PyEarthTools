## Adding archives

`pyearthtools` itself contains no archives, and rely's on extra addons to include them, currently only an NCI addon is available, at [NCI](https://git.nci.org.au/bom/dset/pyearthtools-package/archives/nci.git)

For examples, and documentation on the use of these tools, please see `/Examples/`.
